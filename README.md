# DarkGlass

<p> <strong> DarkGlass </strong> is a general purpose game engine written using Delphi. </p>

DarkGlass is a game engine written from scratch using Delphi, and licensed under the MIT License.

I'll be live streaming the development of DarkGlass, indefinately, at least until the engine is capable of supporting some game development. Though I understand watching someone code isn't the most exciting thing to spend your time on, you're welcome to come watch the live streams at http://youtube.chapmanworld.com (redirect to my channel).

While contributions will be invited at some point in the future, currently this project is in it's infancy and as such contributions are not yet required. I'll update this statement as the project progresses. If you're egar to contribute in some way, feel free to get in touch, but please be patient.
